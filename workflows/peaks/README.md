# Peak calling

Within this workflow we assess the quality of the ChIP-seq experiments using deepTools by analyzing the filtered alignments generated by the previous workflow. We then call peaks on the filtered alignments using macs2.

## Workflow

1. Generate black list file to ignore when assessing experimental reproducibility
2. Summarize all alignments and plot pearson correlation of different experiments
3. Plot "fingerprints" for each experiment
4. Call peaks with macs2 on treatment ChIP sample
5. Call peaks with macs2 on mock ChIP sample (negative control)
